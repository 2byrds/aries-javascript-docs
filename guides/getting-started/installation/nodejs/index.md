# NodeJS

To work with [Aries Framework
JavaScript](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript) we need
to install some dependencies. This includes [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org),
[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) or npm,
[libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium),
[libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) and the
[indy-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk). We will go over the
specific installation process for each platform.
